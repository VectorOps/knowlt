TEST_TEXT = f"""Short paragraph.

This paragraph contains a single, extremely long sentence: it has commas, clauses, and colons
that will require multiple fallback levels, because otherwise the chunk would be far beyond the
token limit; therefore, we must observe how the algorithm behaves.

It was broken into leaves (phrases, and words for one long phrase), which were then packed back
into larger chunks under the token limit. This should result in 5 packed chunks for this paragraph.

Last one."""
