#+title: Design

Goals:
1. Much simpler data model:
   - Nodes having header and type
   - Majority of Nodes should have literal type
   - No signatures or parameters
   - Still resolve file-level imports/exports and resolve dependencies
   - Keep general structure for Project/Repo/Package/File/Node/ImportEdge
   - Much simpler parsers:
     - Special recursive case for nested symbols (classes, structs, functions, etc)
     - Extraction of header for special cases
     - Otherwise all literals
2. Pipelined data layer?
3. No repomap in v1, or ever
